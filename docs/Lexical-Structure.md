Lexical Structure
=================

As it is in other languages, the lexical structure is a set of elementary rules that
specify how to write programs with that language. It is the lowest-level syntax of
a language defining what variable names look like, the delimiter characters for
comments, and what separates one program statement from the next.
 * Case Sensitivity
 * Commenting
 * Literals
